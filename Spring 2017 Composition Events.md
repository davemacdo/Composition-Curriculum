> The Central Florida Composers Forum presents "Celebrating Women Who Compose", a concert featuring local female composers and their works. We've chosen to hold this concert in March since President Obama deemed March "Women's History Month" and March 8th is International Women's Day. Please join us to celebrate these talented women and their contributions to music!

These concerts will likely be ticketed. Details to follow.

## UCF Celebrates the Arts

- 7-15 April

This is a wonderful event, but it tends to suck a lot of time and energy from composers and performers alike. Plan your writing time, meetings, rehearsals, and study time accordingly. You've been warned.

## To be determined:

- Emily Susann Higgins, senior recital
- Zachary Lynn, senior recital

The above events have not yet been scheduled, but will be soon.

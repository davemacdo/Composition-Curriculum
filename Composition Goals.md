# Composition Goals

Plan your compositional projects for the next semester or longer. Strive to create a well-rounded portfolio that achieves your artistic goals. We will discuss this in lessons and refine it throughout the semester and year. Your lesson grades will be determined primarily by your progress toward reaching your goals.

* What are some specific pieces of music would you like to have written this semester?
* What piece(s) would you like to have performed this semester?
* Do you have any other, longer-term composition or performance goals?

For each piece you describe, be as specific as you can be. At minimum, identify the medium (instrumentation) and approximate duration.

## Art in Odd Places UCF

* 9-10 November, intermittent (schedule TBD)

UCF will be hosting its own AiOP event this year. AiOP is a festival created to cause ordinary people to confront art as they go about their day-to-day routine. The composition studio will contribute in some way to be determined. (Note: This is not a concert and will not count toward concert attendance requirements. It is, however, quite rad.)

## Composition Forum Recital

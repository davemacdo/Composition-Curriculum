# Composition: Tonality

## Overview

Write a piece of music for two to three instruments or voices that deals with the concept of tonality and scales. The piece should be 1-3 minutes long[^length] and should *include at least two distinct tonal areas, key centers, or scales.* All compositions will be read in our class reading sessions, so please consider the available performers in our class and technical limitations of sight-readers.

<!--
## Individual meetings

During the week prior to class reading sessions, students will meet one-on-one with the instructor for a lesson. Bring the following to your lesson:

* handwritten or printed copy of any work you have done to this point
* a plan for how the composition will unfold (written, drawn, or in your head)
* staff paper and pencil to take notes
* optional: If you work on a laptop, you may bring your computer in and show your composition in your chosen scoring program.

## Assignment deliverables and readings

Each of these is required. Submit all digital files via Webcourses. Bring paper copies to class for reading sessions.

* **PDF**:
    * Reflection: A brief written description of the how your piece expresses tonality and scales (100-200 words).
* **Paper submission**:
    * hard copy of the score and parts for reading. *Performance materials should be clean, clear, and professional. If you aren't sure what your score or parts should look like, compare them to scores and parts from a major publisher.*

## Grading

Please review the Composition Project Rubric in the Pages tab of Webcourses.

[^length]: Pieces with slower tempos and rhythms should be at the longer end of this range. Pieces with faster tempos and rhythms may be closer to one minute.

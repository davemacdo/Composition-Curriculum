# Listening Assignment

## Introduction

Listening is important. Being able to hear a piece of music and understand its construction is not only critical to evaluating the music of others, but your own music as well. Furthermore, expressing a relevant musical thought in your music requires at least *some* understanding of the repertorial context. Listening critically and analytically is not easy, and it requires practice. Do not listen while doing other things. Sit down and focus as you would while reading a book or watching a movie. This will be difficult at first, but I promise that it will get easier and more rewarding as you practice it.

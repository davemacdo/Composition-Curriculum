These are some documents for the Composition Area at the University of Central Florida. These files are written in Fletcher Penney's MultiMarkdown, which is mostly (but not completely) compatible with Github-Flavored Markdown. Notably, footnotes and file transclusion don't work. So if you seem some weird-looking stuff in the MD rendering on Github, that's why.

I guess you could send me pull requests or submit issues. Not sure why you would, but I'll read 'em.

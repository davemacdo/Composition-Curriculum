# Thinking in the Third Stream

Gunther Schuller (1925 - 2015) created the term "the Third Stream" in a 1957 lecture to describe music that was neither jazz nor classical music. As a performer, Schuller had played horn in the New York Metropolitan Opera orchestra _and_ with Miles Davis's "Birth of the Cool" nonet! The Third Stream was his way of thinking about a new kind of music that was neither jazz nor classical, but combined elements of each.

## Listen

Listen to Schuller's Concertino for Jazz Quartet and Orchestra in the [course playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/davemacdo/playlist/1yRZ66nhTZbLyEj2ygRwNp). Think about what elements you hear come from jazz practice and what comes from classical practice.

Schuller was very clear in his writings that simply transcribing one style of music for the instruments of another style of music was _not_ a useful, expressive statement. This is how you get a pale impersonation.

## Write

Write a _short_ étude for piano, either alone or with a solo instrument, that combines elements of art music and some _specific_ form of folk or popular music. Your étude should be between 12 and 20 measures long and notated as completely as a finished piece.

Include a note at the beginning or end of the score identifying the form of popular or folk music you chose (such as jazz, hip hop, or West African drumming). Explain at least one element you adopted from this music and at least one element you adopted from art music.

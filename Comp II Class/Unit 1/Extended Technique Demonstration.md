Consider your primary instrument. Think about all the cool and wild and strange sounds it can make that are not the way you were taught to play by your teachers. Anything goes, as long as it doesn't harm you, your audience, or your instrument. (In some music, even _that_ is negotiable!)

## Part 1: Techniques

List three to five extended techniques on your instrument that you can perform, even if it requires a little practice or is a little uncomfortable at first. Again, don't hurt yourself, anybody else, or your instrument to make this work.

Write them down, along with a demonstration of their notation. Each should be separate, and clear. (For example, don't give three different multiphonics on the oboe. Multiphonics is a single extended technique.)

If this is an existing technique on your instrument, provide an example of a piece or a recording that uses it (this could be in a non-classical or non-Western tradition). If possible, include a link to YouTube, Soundcloud, etc.

## Part 2: Demonstration

Come to class with your instrument and give a demonstration of each of these techniques. Your notation from the list will be shared as an example with the class. Be prepared to demonstrate variations on the technique, its strengths and limitations, and answer questions.

## Deliverables

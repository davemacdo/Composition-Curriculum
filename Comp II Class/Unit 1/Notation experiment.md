# Notation Experiment

I love science. Don't you? Let's do an experiment. Try to notate the same musical idea in two different ways and listen to how they sound similar and different.

Come up with a relatively simple musical idea. Express that idea in a piece that is at least 30 seconds long, though it could be longer if you want. The instrumentation should be suitable for a class reading session. Be sure to let your classmates know if you are relying on them for the reading so they can be sure to bring their instruments.

## Graphic Notation

Express your musical idea in a graphic score. Focus on the core elements of your idea. Perhaps the contour is more important than the specific pitches, or the gesture and texture are more important than specific meters. Give as much explanation as you need, but be sure to leave some room for the performer to make decisions about the lower priorities. Be as unspecific as possible while still expressing your primary goals.

## Conventional Notation

Use what you know about conventional music notation to express _the same musical idea_ in conventional notation. Be as specific as possible. Leave nothing to chance. Leave as little up to the performer's choice as possible.

## Deliverables

**Paper** (for a change!): Your two scores, on paper, for a class reading session.

Note, because this is a larger assignment, it has twice the normal grade weight.

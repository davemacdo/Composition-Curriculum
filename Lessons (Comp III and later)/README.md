These are some documents for the Composition Area at the University of Central Florida. These files are written in Fletcher Penney's MultiMarkdown, which is mostly (but not completely) compatible with Github-Flavored Markdown. Notably, footnotes and file transclusion don't work. So if you seem some weird-looking stuff in the MD rendering on Github, that's why. I'm planning to set this stuff up on GH pages as well so that it will render correctly there, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. 

I guess you could send me pull requests or submit issues. Not sure why you would, but I'll read 'em.

A few things about our curriculum:

* The courses included here are private lessons for upper division undergraduates and graduate students.
* Most students will be working with this for four semesters, after prerequisites and application/interview.
